To start this react project, you have to open the folder in terminal, and npm start. 
If that does not work, please delete the node modules in the folder, and then npm install --force and then npm start, it should work. 
I have a problem unexpected in the Trash part, when i delete the notes and the go in Trash to delete them permenantly, it does not work sometimes. Otherwise, everything else is good to go. 
In the Preview folder, I will upload pictures of the whole Project.
